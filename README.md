# Steve's Unreal Quest System (SUQS)

## What Is It?

SUQS is a simple, data-driven quest system for Unreal Engine. It helps you define quest structures for your game, 
and track progress against those quests for a player in a simple way. 

Quests are mainly defined in static asset datatables, which can either be edited directly in UE, or written
as JSON - a schema is provided to provide handy autocomplete and validation in most editors 
(see [Editor Setup](docs/EditorSetup.md)).

At runtime, you use a simple API to record progress against these quests: accept quests, complete tasks,
increment progress etc. As tasks are completed they trigger progression based on simple rules, and callbacks
and a query API let you reflect those changes in your world.


## Installing

### Cloning

The best way is to clone this repository as a submodule; that way you can contribute
pull requests if you want. The project should be placed in your project's Plugins folder.

```
> cd YourProject
> git submodule add https://github.com/sinbad/SUQS Plugins/SUQS
> git add ../.gitmodules
> git commit
```

Alternatively you can download the ZIP of this repo and place it in 
`YourProject/Plugins/SUQS`.

### Referencing in C++

Edit YourProject.Build.cs and do something similar to this:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using UnrealBuildTool;

public class YourProject : ModuleRules
{
	private string PluginsPath
	{
		get { return Path.GetFullPath( Path.Combine( ModuleDirectory, "../../Plugins/" ) ); }
	}
	
	protected void AddSUQS() {
		// Linker
		PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "SUQS" });
		// Headers
		PublicIncludePaths.Add(Path.Combine( PluginsPath, "SUQS", "Source", "SUQS", "Public"));
	}

	public SUQSExamples(ReadOnlyTargetRules Target) : base(Target)
	{
		PCHUsage = PCHUsageMode.UseExplicitOrSharedPCHs;

		PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "Core", "CoreUObject", "Engine", "InputCore" });
		
		AddSUQS();
	}
}
```

After adding this you should right-click your .uproject file and "Generate Visual
Studio Project Files". 

## Usage Overview

### Defining Quests

Quests are mainly data tables stored in assets. They shouldn't really be altered dynamically,
because you're tracking progress against them and saving that data so it probably shouldn't be altered 
after the fact. 

> However, you can add and remove quests at runtime if you wish, this can be useful for games with procedural
> missions where the quests are temporary and don't need to be kept forever.

Static quest data doesn't mean you can't have branching quests. Branching within a quest is supported (the branches
are predefined in the data), and also quests can be dependent on each other's success or failure.

While you can edit quest data tables in the UE5 editor, let's see a JSON example 
because it's the easiest to see easily. You can configure your editor to
provide auto-complete and documentation, see [Editor Setup](docs/EditorSetup.md). 
There are lots of optional features, so here is the simplest possible quest:

```json
[
  {
    "Identifier": "Q_Smol",
    "Title": "NSLOCTEXT(\"TestQuests\", \"SmolQuestTitle\", \"Smol Quest\")",
    "DescriptionWhenActive": "NSLOCTEXT(\"TestQuests\", \"SmolQuestDesc\", \"The smallest possible quest\")",
    "Objectives": [
      {
        "Tasks": [
          {
            "Identifier": "T_Smol",
            "Title": "NSLOCTEXT(\"TestQuests\", \"SmolQuestTaskTitle\", \"Easiest possible thing\")"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Some basic notes:
* A single JSON file can include multiple [Quests](docs/Quests.md), each of which must have a globally unique Identifier
* All player-visible text can be localised using NSLOCTEXT
* Each quest is comprised of 1 or more [Objectives](docs/Objectives.md)
  * Objectives are always sequential (but can [branch](docs/Branching.md))
  * Objectives contain [Tasks](docs/Tasks.md), which are the unit of progression
  * Objectives group Tasks, determining whether they are sequential or flexibly ordered, or whether all mandatory tasks have to be completed or only 1 (or 2, or 3...) of those in the group, 
  * Tasks track actual progress, can be mandatory or optional, and can have target numbers (e.g. collect 3 otter's noses, 7 ocelot spleens), and time limits

More details on the specifics can be found in [Quests](docs/Quests.md).

### Quest Progression

Quest definitions are mostly static, but of course your players will progress through
them over time. The main object you'll interact with in SUQS is `USuqsProgression`,
which tracks this, and holds the quest definition library as well. 

It's through `USuqsProgression` that you'll accept quests, complete tasks, 
and store the current status of active quests, and permanently store the quest archive.
For example:

![Accept Quest](docs/img/acceptquest.png)
![Complete Task](docs/img/completetask.png)

This object can be serialized for inclusion in save games. 

See [Quest Progression](docs/Progression.md) for more details.
